## ArcMap workshop for PLHRT 4400


# Map the network drive

We will be using a network drive that has been set up with data files and map documents.  Each student should have read and write access to this folder.

1. Open the Windows File Explorer (yellow folder icon at bottom of screen)
2. Right-click "This PC" > Map Network Drive...
3. Drive = `L:`
4. Folder = `\\files.cornell.edu\fs\dept\ua_cpo\sharedgis\student_share`
5. Press "Finish" and wait for it to connect

Once it connects, the folder should open automatically.  If it fails, try again...


# Open the ArcMap document

Each student should have an .mxd file named "Restoration Ecology Project" followed by their NetID.

1. Double-click the .mxd file with your NetID to open your map.

2. We'll explore the table of contents, turning on different layers, bookmarks, and changing some of the symbology...


# Add more data

First, we'll add a polygon shapefile of plant communities originally created for the NA carbon project.

1. File menu > Add Data > Add Data...
2. In the ArcMap file dialog, browse to Home > GIS Sourcefiles
3. Select and add `NA carbon project.shp`

```
